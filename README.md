Can machine learning classify and evaluate basic Muay Thai techniques using pose estimation?
**Due to privacy reasons and the exam board's instruction the code of the project cannot be public, however if you have any questions feel free to reach out.**

## Overview
This project is my **Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)**.  
The aim is to create an application that allows a user to record themselves performing Muay Thai strikes, then asses their technique using a Machine Learning algorithm.

The project consists of both a research-based investigation** and a practical artefact, supported by planning and evaluation materials.  

## Features
- Core algorithm: **Regex-based detection with a rule-based system** to identify common Python errors and suggest fixes. **May also use other algorithms to test what is best for Martial Arts*
- Frontend: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for an interactive and beginner-friendly interface.  
- Backend: **Flask** to handle requests, process code input, and serve explanations.  
- User-friendly interface with **clear error explanations, suggested fixes, and visual highlighting of problematic code**.  
- Designed to be **scalable and modular**, allowing additional error types and explanations to be added easily in the future.  

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Framework:** Flask (for backend)  
- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- **Libraries/Tools:** [e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.]  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
